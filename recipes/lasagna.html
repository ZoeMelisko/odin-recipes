        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook
                until al dente (firm) according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high
                heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black
                pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Taste and season
                with additional salt if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella cheese, ¼ cup Parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley,
                egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9×13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer
                with 1 cup of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3
                noodles topped with remaining sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the remaining mozzarella cheese and parmesan
                cheese. Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes
                if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>*Note on the sauce:</strong>In this recipe, each layer has about 1 cup of meat sauce. If you prefer
            more sauce in your lasagna, increase the pasta sauce to 48 oz. Salt needed may vary based on the brand of
            pasta sauce used. Taste and season after simmering.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Cheese Layer:</strong>The cheese layers are thin; if you’d prefer a thicker layers cheese, divide the
            cheese in half and put on the first two layers, and add just meat sauce to the third layer. We tested this
            with extra ricotta cheese and found it overpowered the lasagna.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            <strong>Time-Saving Tip:</strong>Use fresh lasagna sheets found in the deli area and skip the boiling step!
            Fresh lasagna doesn’t need to be boiled first.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let the lasagna sit/rest for at least 15 minutes once removed from the oven (even 30-45 minutes is fine).
            This will keep it from becoming runny and help it to keep its shape when cut. Resting is not required when
            reheating.
